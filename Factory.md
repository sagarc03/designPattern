# Factory Method

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Use the Factory Method pattern when

* a class can’t anticipate the class of objects it must create.
* a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
* classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.

Structure Participants

* Product – defines the interface of objects the factory method creates.
* ConcreteProduct – implements the Product interface.
* Creator – declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product. Creator may also define a default implementation of the factory method that returns a default ConcreteProduct object. – may call the factory method to create a Product object.
* ConcreteCreator – overrides the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct.
